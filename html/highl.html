<h2><a name="sh"></a>Syntax highlighting</h2>

TeXlipse supports real time syntax highlighting for both LaTeX and BibTeX files.

<h3>The LaTeX editor highlights the following entries:</h3> 

<ul>
<li>LaTeX-keywords, i.e. a slash followed by one or more letters
<li>LaTeX command symbols, i.e. a slash followed by one symbol (non-letter, 7-bit ascii symbol)
<li>Special characters, e.g. \
<li>Comments, i.e. from a % to the end of the current line
<li>Mathematical commands, e.g. sequences limited by \begin{equation}...\end{equation} or $...$
<li>Command arguments, i.e. a sequence following a command and limited by { and }
<li>Optional command arguments, i.e. a sequence following a command and limited by [ and ]
<li>Verbatim environments, e.g. sequences surrounded by \begin{verbatim} and \end{verbatim} or 
\begin{lstlisting} and \end{lstlisting}</li>
</ul>

<h3>The BibTeX editor highlights the following entries:</h3>

<ul>
<li>BibTeX entry keywords, e.g. @MISC, @BOOK
<li>Reference keys and field names, e.g. title, author, year
<li>Strings, e.g. numbers representing years, text delimited by " and "
<li>Special characters, i.e. # = and ,
<li>Comments, but only from a % to the end of the current line &mdash; not all that is counted as a BibTeX -comment
</ul>

The user can determine her own syntax highlight colors for both LaTeX and BibTeX files on the
<a href="config.html">Texlipse preferences page</a>.

<h2><a name="ind"></a>Indenting</h2>

<p>TeXlipse supports the indentation of different environments, for example:</p>

<p><pre>
\begin{enumerate}
  \item a
  \item b
\end{enumerate}	
</pre></p>

<p>In this case the environment used is <code>enumerate</code>. Default 
environments that are indented are <code>list</code>, <code>enumerate</code> 
and <code>itemize</code>. Indentation can be done automatically while writing
or the user can correct the indentation of the selected area by pressing 
<b><code>ctrl + i</code></b> or <b>Latex &gt; Correct Indentation</b>
from menubar.</p>

<p>The user can configure which environments she wants to have indented.
This can be done on the <a href="config.html">Texlipse preferences page</a>.
The Preferences page contains a checkbox that can be used to determine 
whether indentation is active. The Preferences page also contains a text 
field where the width of the indentation can be changed. The environments 
to indent can be seen in a list. The user can add more LaTeX environments 
to be indented by clicking the <b>New...</b> button and writing the name of the 
new environment in the pop up dialog. Environments can be removed by selecting 
the environment to remove and clicking the <b>Remove</b> button.</p>
