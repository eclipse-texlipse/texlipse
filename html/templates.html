<h1>What are templates?</h1>

<p>We separate templates into two classes: editor templates
  and document templates. Editor templates are small
  LaTeX-code pieces, that can
  be inserted into the document (hence making the 
  writing process a bit easier and faster.) These templates
  consist of a fixed part (that the writer does not need to change
  when inserting the template) and variables, which point out the parts of
  the template that the writer should change. Document
  templates are entire LaTeX documents, which serve
  as a starting point for writing new documents. 
</p>

<h2><a name="edi"></a>Editor templates</h2>

<p>Two different sets of templates are provided
  with TeXlipse: LaTeX and BibTeX templates. The
  former can be used when editing LaTeX files (*.tex, *.ltx)
  and the latter one with BibTeX files (*.bib).
</p>

<h3>Using editor templates</h3>

<p>Use them the same way as command completions, just hit <code>ctrl + space</code>
	(or what your content assist activation key is bound to)
  and list of available templates shows up. The available
  templates are determined based on text just before
  the cursor &mdash; only templates whose beginning match that
  text are shown (which could be none). If there is
  whitespace (i.e. spaces, tabs and linebreaks)
  before the cursor, all templates are shown. 
</p>

<p>After you have chosen the template, you need to
  fill in the template&#39;s variables: you can edit
  the currently selected variable, and you can rotate
  between variables with TAB. After you are ready with
  the template, hit ENTER to finish the template.
</p>

<h3>Sounds nice, can I define my own templates?</h3>

<p>Yes you can. Go to the <b>Window &gt; Preferences</b> and
  further to <b>Texlipse &gt; Editor &gt; Templates</b> or
  <b>Texlipse &gt; BibTeX Editor &gt; Templates</b>. The editor templates
  are managed trough these pages
  (add, remove, modify, disable or enable).<p>  

<p>When creating templates, use "${variablename}" to
  insert variables into templates. If the
  same variable value needs to be used more than once,
  just use the same variable name. You can use the
  ${cursor} variable to determine the place where
  the cursor should be after the template is finished.

  <p>An example:
<pre>
\begin{${environment}}
  ${cursor}
\end{${environment}}
</pre> 
  </p>
 
<h2><a name="doc"></a>Document templates</h2>

<p>There are two different types of document templates,
  system and user-defined templates. The difference is
  that you need to have administrative rights to
  Eclipse to change the system templates (which are available
  to everyone). The user defined templates are instead
  personal templates visible only to the corresponding
  user.</p>

<h3>How are document templates used?</h3>

<p>Document templates can be used when a new LaTeX project
  is created. The first lines of the document templates
  are read and the lines starting with "%%" are considered
  to be descriptions of the templates. (Reading the templates ends
  immediately after a line that does not start with "%%" is
  encountered.) So if you define your own templates
  (see the following sections),
  it might be useful to add few "%%" lines containing
  a description in the beginning of the templates.</p>

<h3>Managing user defined templates</h3>

  <p>To add your own document templates, right click
    the editor area and select "Save As Template".
    To manage (remove) older user defined templates
    go to <b>Windows &gt; preferences</b> and further to
    <b>Texlipse &gt; Project Templates</b>.</p>


<h3>Managing system templates</h3>

<p>The system templates are located in the templates -directory
  under the &lt;texlipse plugin directory&gt;: all .tex
  files in that directory are considered to be document
  templates. By adding files there, system administrators can add
  templates that are available to all users.</p>
