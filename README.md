In other words, TeXlipse includes quite a complete set of features for day-to-day editing tasks. This manual explains the use of these features in detail, but please go ahead and explore TeXlipse!

TeXlipse version 1.0 was brought to you by the Texlapse-team as a software project on the SoberIT lab of the Helsinki University of Technology. The Texlapse-team includes (in alphabetical order): Taavi Hupponen, Kimmo Karlsson, Jani Laitinen, Oskar Ojala, Antti Pirinen, Esa Seuranen and Laura Takkinen.

TeXlipse version 1.5.0 was developed from 1.0 as an open source project on SourceForge. The team that developed it consisted of Oskar Ojala, Kimmo Karlsson, Boris von Loesch, Tor Arne Vestbø and Matthias Merll. Additionally, several contributions were received from users of TeXlipse.

Since 1.5.0 TeXlipse has been taken over by the Eclipse Foundation and is being developed by a team from the [Eclipse Science Working Group](https://science.eclipse.org "Eclipse Science Working Group"). The first release from this team will be numbered 2.0.0.

TeXlipse uses [Jazzy](http://jazzy.sourceforge.net/ "Jazzy") since version 1.4.0 for spell checking.

# Current status

The TeXlipse project has been dormant for a few years, but it is still very popular with it's users. So committers from the Eclipse Foundation has volunteered to maintain it for the benefit of us all. It may be a while before we're happy with the situation, as there is a lot of work to do before everything is up to date. We'll do a new release as soon as we can, after that we'll start mending the code and documentation – and maybe do some improvements.

Please have a look at our [contribution guide](https://github.com/eclipse/texlipse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md "Contribution Guide") if you would like to help out.
