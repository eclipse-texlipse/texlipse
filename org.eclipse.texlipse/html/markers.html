<h1>Task and error markers</h1>

<h2><a name="taskann"></a>Task markers</h2>

<p>Suppose you want to leave a note somewhere that you should update some section
    of a document. In the Eclipse Java Editor, it is possible to place TODO, FIXME and XXX
	keywords in comments, which will in turn appear in the task view along with the
	comment. A comment which
    starts with optional whitespace followed by the keyword TODO, FIXME or XXX is interpreted as a
	task marker and the text in the comment following the keyword is shown in the Task view,
	along with the file name and line number of the marker in question.
</p>

<h2><a name="errann"></a>Error annotations</a></h2>

<p>
The plug-in tries to indicate if there are errors in the document.
For example, if <b><code>\ref</code></b> or <b><code>\cite</code></b> are 
referring to references 
that do not exist, a warning annotation is shown. Also, subsections without a
preceding section (or subsubsection without a preceding subsection) cause
a warning annotation (the warning annotation is a yellow triangle with a black
exclamation mark).
</p>

<p>It is worth noting that referencing errors are displayed conservatively,
i.e. a warning always indicates an unresolved reference (unless you use imports
from outside of the project defining references), but some references without
an error marker shown can be wrong. Since <code>\thebibliography</code> is not
supported, bibliography entries defined with it are not taken into
account when checking <code>\cite</code> -commands.</p>

<p>If there are some serious problems, e.g. unbalanced begin-end -blocks, 
the error annotation is shown (the error annotation is a red circle 
with a white X-mark). A common problem is a missing } -brace. { and } are
always special characters in LaTeX (excluding the <code>verb</code> 
and <code>verbatim</code> environments) and in text you should escape
them by writing \{ and \} if you want them to show up in the output.</p>

<p>There are many cases where TeXlipse warns the user
of a situation that is likely wrong and issues a warning, but in situations that
are obviously wrong, an error is issued. In particular, unbalanced begin-end blocks
and missing } make it impossible to continue parsing the document, so the outline and
code folds cannot be updated until these problems are fixed in the document.
Some of the errors come as a result of building from the <code>latex</code>-program
and these are all shown as error annotations.</p>

<p>TeXlipse 1.1.0 introduces the layout error, which is a new class of warning
markers that represent layout errors reported by the <code>latex</code>-program,
e.g. overfull hbox. These show up as regular warnings, but if they are
disturbing, they can be filtered in the problems log.</p>

<p>The rule of thumb is that if the <code>latex</code>-program halts with 
the problem it is annotated with an error annotation. Otherwise it is annotated
with a warning annotation.</p>
