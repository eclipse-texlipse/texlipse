<h1>References</h1>

<h2>What are references?</h3>

  <p>References are a crafty way of referring to a another
  part of the document, so that you can rearrange the
  document freely and not mess up your references. Pretty much
  everything can be referred to &mdash; sections, tables, figures, etc.
  </p> 
  
  <p>Other kind of references are citations, which
  are references to other article, papers, books or such.
  See the <a href="bibtex.html">BibTeX</a> part of this
  help for further information on citations.</p>
  
<h3>Sounds nice, so does it work in practice?</h3>
<a name="label"></a>

  <p>Using references is straightforward, just use the
  command <i>\label{myref}</i> to mark the part you want
  to refer to. Hint 1: insert the <i>\label{}</i> as soon
  as possible, preferably right in the beginning
  of sections or different environments. Hint 2:
  for environments in which <i>\caption{}</i> command is
  used &mdash; like tables and figures &mdash; insert the <i>\label{}</i>
  command <b>after</b> the <i>\caption{}</i> command.
  
  <p>After having your labels defined, you can
  just use the command <i>\ref{myref}</i> to do the referring.
  You can also refer to the page where the referrable thing
  resides with the command <i>\pageref{myref}</i>. Example:    

  <pre>
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
You can refer to Table~\ref{table:pi} on page \pageref{table:pi}
before the actual reference\dots

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{c|r@{.}l}
  Variable &amp; \multicolumn{2}{c}{Value} \\
  \hline
  $\pi$ &amp; 3 &amp; 14159 \\ 
  $\pi^3$ &amp; 31 &amp; 01 \\
  \end{tabular}
\caption{Some $\pi$ related rounded values}
\label{table:pi} 
\end{table}

and referring to Table~\ref{table:pi} works afterwards
works as well.
\end{document}
  </pre>
  
  
  <h2><a name="ref"></a>Yes... the reference system comes with LaTeX, so why gloat about?</h2>
  
  <p>When the document gets larger, you just cannot remember
  all those references anymore (and you have to search the
  for the references, which just wastes time) &mdash; this is where
  TeXlipse steps in: just type "\ref{" and hit <code>ctrl + space</code> (or what content 
      assist is bound to on your system) and
  you see the list of available references (or if you remember
  the beginning of the reference, just type it in too to narrow
  down the shown references.) The command <i>\pageref{}</i>
  works in the same way.
  </p>
  <p>If <i>Highlight selected references and ...</i> is turned on in the preferences, 
  TeXlipse also highlights the label and all references of the currently
  selected reference or label in the current file. 
  </p>
  <p>But that's not all. If the cursor is on a reference you can use the magic F3 key (or
  use <i>Open Declaration</i> from the main or context menu) to jump to the correspondig label!
  How funky is that?</p>
  <h3>But I use <i>\input{file}</i> to separate my document
  into several more easily handled files... does this mess up
  things?</h3>
  
  <p>No worries. All references are searched from the
	LaTeX -files in the project and they will be available in
	the content assist menu and will be found by <i>Open Declaration</i>.
  </p>

<h2>My special \label environment doesn't work...</h2>

<p>Basic label commands and labels in self-defined commands are supported so
that the first mandatory argument must be the label argument. More complex
environments (e.g. lstlistings) might define their own label environments, which are not
currently supported in TeXlipse.</p>
