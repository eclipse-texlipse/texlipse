<h1>Taking advantage of the document outline</h1>

<h2> Basic use </h2>

<p> The outline view shows the outline of the document currently
opened in the editor. Selecting an element in the outline focuses
the editor to the corresponding text in the document.
The collapse and expand buttons collapse/expand the outline tree
one level.</p>

<p>The update button can be used to update the outline if automatic
parsing is not enabled. This button is disabled when the outline
is up to date.</p>

<h2> Filtering the elements of the outline </h2>

<p>The contents of the outline can be filtered by using the outline 
view toolbar buttons. Note that hiding an element also hides all
the element's children regardless of whether the children would
otherwise be visible or not. For example, hiding sections will hide
all the subsections which are children of any sections. However, a 
single subsection without a section parent would remain visible.</p>

<p>Elements availabe in the outline can be configured through the 
<b>TeXlipse &gt; Editor &gt; Outline</b> preference page.

<h2><a name="ccp"></a> Manipulating elements with copy, cut, paste and delete </h2>

<p>You can manipulate the elements of the outline by selecting an 
element and then selecting an operation from the context menu 
(right-click with the mouse on the element) or from the Edit menu in the
menubar. All the operations are text based. This means that 
deleting an element really removes the text from the document and
copying an element actually copies the text contents of the 
elements to the clipboard. When using paste in the outline the text 
in the clipboard is inserted <i>after the text of the target element</i>.</p>

<p>These operations are only enabled when the outline is 
up to date</p>


<h2><a name="dad"></a> Dragging and dropping elements </h2>

<p>Elements can also be manipulated by dragging and dropping. 
Dragging and dropping an element over another element will move the
text of the source element <i>after the text of the target element</i>.</p>

<p> Holding down the Ctrl key while dropping will result in a copy 
operation instead of a move operation.
An element cannot be dropped over itself or over its
children. As with the copy/paste operations, dragging and dropping
is only enabled when the outline is up to date.</p>

<h1>Full document outline</h1>

<p>The full document outline is a separate view that shows an outline of the
entire project. This is done by starting from the main file of the project
and merging all included files into the outline. The full documetn outline
can be viewed by selecting <b>Window &gt; Show view &gt; Other...</b> and from
there <b>TeXlipse &gt; Full LaTeX outline</b>.</p>

<p>The full document outline works exactly as the single-file outline, but it
should be noted that only <code>\input</code> and <code>\include</code> -includes
are handled &ndash; not custom includes. Also, the outline has been designed to
be fast, which could mean that some omplex include chains may not be resolved
correctly. If this happens, the document author should consider whether a
straightforward document hierarchy would suffice.</p>
