<h1>Wrapping text</h1>

<p>
TeXlipse supports three different line wrapping modes: 
<ol>
  <li><a href="#softWrap">Soft wrap mode</a></li>
  <li><a href="#hardWrap">Hard wrap mode</a></li>
  <li><a href="#actWrap">Action based hard wrap</a></li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Use and Configuration:</h2>

<p>The workbench menu contains a button for text wrapping. The button is
visible when at least one .tex-file is open. The button is used to
cycle between the modes <strong>off</strong> (word wrap disabled),
<strong>soft wrap</strong> and <strong>hard wrap</strong>. If the toggle
button is down then word wrap is used; the icon changes its color based on the
active mode: green for soft wrap, red for hard wrap. The description of the
two modes is provided below.</p>

<p>
The user can configure line wrapping in the <a href="config.html">Texlipse preferences 
page</a>. The page contains a radio button list from where the user can determine is line 
wrapping mode soft wrap or hard wrap. The user can also determine the maximum line 
width (line width works now only with hard wrap). The default line width is 80 
characters.
</p>

<p>
Do note that LaTeX does not care about a white space in normal text, so whether the linebreaks 
are in the file itself or only displayed on the screen does not affect the output of LaTeX.
</p>

<h2>Modes:</h2>

<h3><a name="softWrap"></a>Soft wrap mode</a></h3>
<p>
Soft wrap means that the file being edited is not changed by the wrapping, ie. no line 
delimiters will be automatically added to the document. Lines being only displayed as if 
they were wrapped. Hard wrap on the other hand adds line delimiters when necessary, 
thus making the wrapping a part of the document. <strong>WARNING:</strong> As of Eclipse 3.0,
there is a bug in Eclipse&#39;s soft wrap implementation, causing the positions in the vertical
bar (the code folding an error annotations, the position markers) to be out of synch with the
editor view (the problem is purely visual, the folds work correctly). Additionally, soft wrapping
is quite slow. Due to these issues, the user is advised to proceed with caution if intending to 
use soft wrap.
</p>

<h3><a name="hardWrap">Hard wrap mode</a></h3>

<p>
In Hard wrap mode, TeXlipse examines the line length after every typed white space. 
If the length of the line is greater than the maximum value, the last white space
position before maximum is searched and a line delimiter is inserted there. If there
is not any white space before the maximum value, then the first one after maximum is searched and
the line delimiter is inserted there.
</p>

<p>
If the length of the next line + the length of the wrapped line <strong>from</strong>
the inserted line delimiter <strong>to</strong> the end of the line is less than the 
maximum line length, the wrapped text is inserted to the beginning of the next line. 
If the line length after this insertion would be greater than the maximum length, a 
new line is added.
</p>

<p> Note that the white spaces due to indentation are not counted. If we assume our
indentation to be 15 characters, the maximum line length to be 80 and we write a string
that is 70 characters long (does not contain white spaces), then the total length of the 
line will be 85.
</p>

<h3><a name="actWrap"></a>Action based hard wrap</a></h3>

<p>The user can perform a hard wrap function to the selected text area. To use this 
feature, the user must first select the area and then press <strong>Esc Q</strong>
or select <b>Latex &gt; Correct Line Wrap</b>.
The user can also select the text, activate the conext menu (right-click the text editor view)
and select the <strong>Correct Line Wrap</strong> entry from context menu.</p>

<p>Note 1: The comment lines are ignored.</p>

<p>Note 2: The function takes the indentation of the first selected line and 
uses that for all lines in that paragraph. When the function finds a new paragraph
it will examine the new indentation from the first line and uses that for every line 
in that paragraph.</p>
