<h1>Starting a new LaTeX project</h1>

<p>
To create a new LaTeX project, select <b>New &gt; Project...</b> 
and from the Texlipse category select <b>New Latex project</b>.
</p>

<p>
The New Latex Project -wizard allows you to choose a name and a
template for the project. To start with an empty document, select
the Blank template. There are a few templates offered to choose from,
and you can add your own by editing a document and setting it as a
template (more on that later).</p>

<p>With the wizard you can also configure the 
output format for the document. In addition, you can configure 
the structure of the project. This means that you can specify the 
project main source and output files and define specific directories
to be used for project source, output and temporary files. The builder
will then handle automatically moving the files around, so you do not need to
move your files yourself to avoid a cluttered project view in the package
explorer.
