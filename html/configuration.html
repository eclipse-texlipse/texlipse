<h1>Part 2: How to configure TeXlipse </h1>
<p>
Before you can configure the TeXlipse plugin you must have some 
working LaTeX distribution installed on your system.
</p>

<p><strong>0. </strong> Make sure you have a working Tex distribution. You need 
to have at least the <strong>latex</strong> program, but <strong>Bibtex</strong>, 
<strong>Makeindex</strong>, <strong>DviPdf</strong>, <strong>DviPs</strong>,
<strong>PdfLatex</strong>,<strong>PsLatex</strong> and <strong>Ps2Pdf</strong>
are also recommended.</p>

<p><Strong>1. </strong> Open <b>Window &gt; Preferences</b>, and from there 
the <b>TeXlipse &gt; Builder Settings</b> preference page.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Use the <Strong>Browse...</strong> button to set the location
of the <strong>installation (Bin for binary) directory of your LaTeX distribution</strong>. 
To use the selected 
directory, click the <strong>Apply</strong> button. The plugin will automatically
set the correct paths for all the listed programs that are located in the given directory.
If some of the programs is not found in the directory, the parentheses after the program name
are empty (in the following image, such a program is the PsLatex-program).</p>

<p><Strong>3.</strong> To set the path of a particular program, select 
the program and click the <strong>Edit...</strong> button. The following 
window will appear. Use the <Strong>Browse...</strong> button to set 
the program path. If you want to change some parameters for the program
you can also do that here. Confirm the path and the parameters by clicking 
the <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Next, select the <strong>Viewer settings</strong> page.
You must set paths of the used viewers. As with the LaTeX distribution at step 2,
set the correct path for the viewer you are going to use. Also make sure
that the viewer is registered to the right format (for example, pdf for acroread)</p>

<p>Note also, that the plugin uses the first viewer on the list that matches the current output format</p>
